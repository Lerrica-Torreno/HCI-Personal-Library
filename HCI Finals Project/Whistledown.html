                        Exact pieces of words I can describe while reading Jonaxx's books, and what we have here 
                        is the Good Lips Series or the GLS and Until Trilogy or UT. Pure feelings, emotions and deep

                        I ended up re-reading Taming the Waves, and wow, it still hits just as hard. The trauma, the abuse,

                                        she saw it as her only chance to ask for forgiveness, praying her quiet voice would be enough to reach him.

                                        her way, life took a turn. Now, with the odds stacked against her, Katherine must choose: how do you keep playing when the game
